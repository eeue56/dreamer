Dream journal of vivid dreamer


The barn
--------

Being taught in classroom by a teacher that gives me the feel it was Miss Wagstaff. Face not seen. Sitting to my left is Ross. Teacher is talking, but words unclear. She passes out random tests to students in the class, one at a time. Ross is given one, he has to trace and identify the "ph" pattern in word cutouts from labels. I consider it easy, and hope she doesn't give me one. She gives me one, after Ross has finished. I have to spot "sm". One of the cutouts looks like a formge fre label. The whole time, I am aware of a barn connected to the school. The barn has a special room, which is empty but with some rafters suspended over open air. I am under the rafters, and hiding. I see someone walk past. I get the feeling they are a creep. They walk up a hill that looks like Bangor's bitch hill at the bottom, but with bushes. For some reason, I get the sensation that they are hiding in the bushes. Another person (AE?) from school walks past, sees me, and asks if I had seen the creepy guy. I tell him he's in the Bushes. I now hide on the rafters. I see Rhydian Stonehouse, and he sees me too. For some reason, his eyes fill me with terror. The rafters collapse, and I am left lying on the floor, still making eyecontact with Rhydian. The dream ends.
