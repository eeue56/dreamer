Dream journal of lucid dreamer


The barn
--------

Being taught in classroom by a teacher that gives me the feel it was Miss Wagstaff. Face not seen. Sitting to my left is Ross. Teacher is talking, but words unclear. She passes out random tests to students in the class, one at a time. Ross is given one, he has to trace and identify the "ph" pattern in word cutouts from labels. I consider it easy, and hope she doesn't give me one. She gives me one, after Ross has finished. I have to spot "sm". One of the cutouts looks like a formge fre label. The whole time, I am aware of a barn connected to the school. The barn has a special room, which is empty but with some rafters suspended over open air. I am under the rafters, and hiding. I see someone walk past. I get the feeling they are a creep. They walk up a hill that looks like Bangor's bitch hill at the bottom, but with bushes. For some reason, I get the sensation that they are hiding in the bushes. Another person (AE?) from school walks past, sees me, and asks if I had seen the creepy guy. I tell him he's in the Bushes. I now hide on the rafters. I see Rhydian Stonehouse, and he sees me too. For some reason, his eyes fill me with terror. The rafters collapse, and I am left lying on the floor, still making eyecontact with Rhydian. The dream ends.

Talking about school with friends.

Meaning:

Unknown. It focuses a lot around being able to sense who someone was and their intentions without being able to see them properly. Perhaps that means something?


The cliff
---------

Extended family at a river, with a cliff on each side. Cliffs joined by one of those "thin plank of wood suspended by chains" bridges, high high up. River is shallow. Cliff on one side has a climbing-wall for people to be guided around while climbing it. It's not very high. I am by the river side with an uncle, who is a noted climber. We are watching his daughter on the climbing wall. She is used to climbing. She falls off, and is left screaming and dangling from the safety rope. The guide pulls her up, but fails to get her over the edge as she is screaming too much. I dash over the river and climb the wall, then pull her up. She does not stop screaming. My uncle and I force her towards the bridge. She refuses with all her strength to cross it. Next thing I know, her emotions are mine. I am on the bridge but I am deadly scared of the height, whereas before it was fine. I feel as though I will die if I stay on the bridge. My mind turns to flying in a plane, and decides that's also a bad thing. I wake wth fear still with me.

Talking about travelling via plane, sister being a teenager and speaking to my uncle.

Meaning:

Empathy for those who seem childish or stubborn. Fear of heights.

The children
------------

I am a small boy again. 7 or 8. There are thousands of other children around me. My brother is there. We are all joined somehow, but I don't see how. The dream ends.

Unsure, but I was thinking about my childhood earlier.

The bag
-------

I am on a surprise visit to friends I made in another country. I am cloaked, and carrying a huge huge bag. The bag makes movement in any direction other than forward very difficult. I spot one of my friends from afar with someone, and decide to try to catch up to them. The someone leaves, and my friend starts to run. I manage to keep up, but only just. They start talking on their phone to another friend of mine. They turn around in a pathway, and run back the way we came, running past me. As they pass me, they smile, but they do not say anything. I continue on my way to my friend's house, but awake before arriving.
